# GuardianEye — AI Print Failure Detection for OctoPrint

**Open-source, no subscription, 6 AI providers including 100% local/free with Ollama.**

GuardianEye watches your 3D prints through your webcam and uses AI vision to detect failures like spaghetti, bed detachment, and printing into air. When it sees a problem, it stops your print automatically — saving filament, time, and your sanity.

## Why GuardianEye over Obico / The Spaghetti Detective?

# Pull a vision model
ollama pull llava

# That's it! Select "Ollama" in GuardianEye settings
```

## How It Works

### The 3-Strike System

GuardianEye doesn't stop your print on a single bad frame. Instead:

1. **Snapshot** — Captures a webcam image on a configurable interval (default: 60s)
2. **AI Analysis** — Sends the image + context-aware prompt to your chosen AI provider
3. **Verdict** — AI returns `OK` or `FAIL` with a reason
4. **Strike Counter** — `FAIL` increments the counter; `OK` resets it to zero
5. **Emergency Stop** — Only after N consecutive FAILs (default: 3) does it stop the print

This means a single ambiguous frame won't kill your print, but persistent spaghetti will be caught quickly.

### Stage-Aware Detection

The AI prompt adapts to the print stage:

- **Early (layer 1-5):** "Very little material is visible — this is NORMAL"
- **Mid:** "Objects should be visibly forming with stacked layers"
- **Late (>80%):** "Objects should be nearly complete with full height"

### The "Poop Test"

Our prompt is specifically trained to handle pre-existing debris on the bed:

> _ANY pre-existing objects, blobs, filament scraps, or debris sitting on the bed — these are leftovers from previous prints and are completely NORMAL._

This prevents false positives from old purge blobs, failed print remnants, or general bed mess.

## Cost Estimates

Running at default 60s interval during an 8-hour print (~480 checks):

| Provider  | Model            | Per Check | 8hr Print |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Gemini    | gemini-2.0-flash | $0.0001   | ~$0.05    |
| OpenAI    | gpt-4o-mini      | $0.0003   | ~$0.14    |
| OpenAI    | gpt-4.1-mini     | $0.0003   | ~$0.14    |
| Anthropic | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.001    | ~$0.48    |
| Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4  | $0.005    | ~$2.40    |
| Ollama    | llava            | $0.00     | $0.00     |

## FAQ

**Q: Will this work with my webcam?**
A: If your webcam serves JPEG snapshots via HTTP (like mjpeg-streamer), yes. This covers most OctoPrint webcam setups.

**Q: Does it work without internet?**
A: Yes, if you use Ollama. All other providers require internet access.

**Q: What happens if the AI API is down?**
A: API errors are non-fatal. The print continues; the check is simply skipped.

**Q: Can I use this with OctoPrint's built-in webcam?**
A: Yes. GuardianEye auto-detects your OctoPrint webcam snapshot URL.

**Q: How do I reduce false positives?**
A: Increase the strike count (e.g., 5 instead of 3), or use a more capable model. Mark false positives to track your FP rate.

## Architecture

```
OctoPrint Event (PrintStarted)
    → PrintMonitor.start()
        → RepeatedTimer(60s)
            → capture_snapshot(webcam_url)
            → build_vision_prompt(layer, progress)
            → VisionProvider.analyze(image, prompt)
            → Strike system (FAIL → increment, OK → reset)
            → 3 strikes → printer.cancel_print() + notify
            → send_plugin_message() → Knockout.js UI update
```
